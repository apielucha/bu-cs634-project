							Welcome to our space! Come in and break some bread with us and your

							The bakery was established by two siblings with the initial idea of selling 
							fresh bread. Every Sunday during family dinner there would be a fresh 
							loaf of bread that would be broken into pieces for everyone to share.  
							The siblings used their family tradition of breaking bread during a 
							family meal as their inspiration and vision for the bakery. The siblings 
							wanted to create a bakery known to their customers as the place to get 
							fresh bread to take home for their own family or to simply sit in the store, 
							“break bread” and share in an experience of some delicious bread.  As 
							the business continued to grow, they expanded their market by selling 
							other products, such as cakes, cookies, and pastries.
